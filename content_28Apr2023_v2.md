## Welcome to Our Work-In-Progress!

We're excited to share a sneak peak of our project with AGM attendees.

<br>

## Our Vision
Our HQP working group spans researchers working across scales (*e.g.*, local field studies, landscape/regional modeling studies). We are united in our goals to share our research with a broader audience and to discuss challenges and successes of monitoring and modeling ecosystem services across scales in Canada. We are creating a story map to discuss shared challenges and solutions related to scaling.

<br>

## Current Status
This draft story map is under construction. We are sharing this draft to start a discussion about scaling and about how to best present our findings to a general audience. We welcome any suggestions, as we continue to develop this story map during and after the AGM.

# Introduction

<br>

## Different scale(s) are most meaningful for a given decision or research question

<br>

We design studies at different scales, because

<br>

(1) decision-makers require data at different spatio-temporal scales and

<br>

(2) scientists seek to understand how ecosystem processes and properties vary across scales.

<br>

There are cost and time constraints to collecting data; therefore, we target the scale most relevant for a given question or decision.

*Created by Ágnes Vári. The idea behind this drawing is to start as a decision-maker, researcher, and/or explorer, and show how the view (scale) may change, in a fun way, before we dive into the scientific details. We will finish this sketch after the AGM. *

<br>
<br>

## Defining terms

<br>

*[Placeholder text: We plan to hire an illustrator to create a visual defining the terms: ecosystem service, supply, demand, flow, benefit, etc. There will be one hexagon at a landscape scale and a second hexagon nested behind at a regional scale. We will also add a glossary section for readers to find more information on the terms used in this story map.]*

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Changing spatial and temporal scales

<br>

Often data is only available (or can only be collected) at one scale; however, we need information at a different scale to inform a decision or to understand an ecological process. In the figure below we visualize what it means to increase

<br>

(a) spatial grain size,

<br>

(b) spatial extent,

<br>

(c) temporal resolution, and

<br>

(d) time period.

<br>
<br>

## Why do we scale up or down?

<br>

We may scale up or down for many reasons, including these examples:

1.   It can be expensive, time-consuming, and dangerous to collect data points in the field at every possible location. Instead, we stratify (e.g., partition) a larger landscape into smaller homogenous areas and take representative samples within each group.

2.   Ecological processes can be difficult to observe directly, including when processes are too fast, too slow, too small, or too large. We develop models to visualize a reality that is inaccessible to our senses.

3.   Management and policy decisions may require data at a different scale (e.g., extent or grain) compared to the scale of available data. For example, we may collect field data about a management intervention at a local scale; however, we may rely on models to test how scaling these interventions could affect outcomes at a larger scale.

4.  There are many decision-makers at different (nested) spatial scales, with their own mandates, agendas, and actions. Land-use planning policies are often developed considering scales that represent political needs at regional scales, which may or may not be consistent with ecological and societal needs at local scales. For example, climate change mitigation actions at a national scale, may not address heterogeneous needs at finer scales, for example cooling effects at the neighborhood scale.

## As a part of ResNet we research these scaling topics

<br>

### What is ResNet?

<br>

We are part of the ResNet network that unites a broad community of scholars, NGO, government, and industry sectors. We are based in different working landscapes across Canada, and our aim is to improve our capacity to monitor, model, and manage these landscapes and all the ecosystem services that they provide for long-term well-being and shared prosperity.

<br>
<br>

### Introduction to the process of creating this story map

<br>

Together as students and postdocs within the multi-scale ResNet network, we discuss a few of the challenges and best practices related to scaling. *[Add link to who we are? section]*.

## Things change as we change scales

<br>

### Introduction

Environmental processes & properties can change as we change scales (both grain and extent). However, more often, the method choices we make can lead to misleading results as we extend our research to other scales. These choices include how we decide where to draw boundaries, deal with non-linearities, and account for inconsistent baselines. We illustrate this challenge with several case studies, including…

* Why does spatial resolution matter?

* How do we draw boundaries to aggregate data?

* How to consider non-linearities?

* How does the monitoring time period influence outcomes?

## Why does spatial resolution matter?

<br>

### Introduction

When we change the spatial resolution of a pixel, we change the number and type of elements (for example landcover types) that compose it. This highly impacts outcomes where we attempt to classify pixels based on their composition.

<br>

![figure_name](Content/Challenges/Challenge2a/FigureMixedPixel.png)

## Why does spatial resolution matter?

<br>

### Case study

In the figure on the top right, we show two major forest disturbance agents (panel a) and the results of a geo-spatial trend analysis (panel b to d) over a relatively small study area (26,000 ha) located along the northern boundary of Algonquin Park. The vegetation greenness of forests, as measured by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), shows many trend breakpoints over an 18-year long period (2003-2020). Trend breakpoints refer to structural changes in the trend line of a measurement. Trend breakpoints can be positive or negative and can result from forest natural and anthropogenic disturbances.

When using MODIS derived NDVI at a 250 m resolution (panel  b) we find 312 different trend breakpoints in the data. Most of these are negative breakpoints (orange color pixels), meaning that some forest areas have experienced important decreases in greenness at some particular point in time.  However, there are also some forest areas that have seen significant increases (turquoise color pixels) in greenness at a particular point in time. When a 500 m resolution NDVI time series is used instead (panel c), the number of breakpoints drops to 71. Similarly, when a 1 km resolution NDVI time series is used (panel d), the number of breaks further decreases to 17.  

Interestingly, not only does the number (and direction/sign) of forest pixels with trend breakpoints change depending on the resolution of the data but also the pixel locations over the study area.  Some of these trend breakpoint pixels spatially and temporally overlap with forest harvest and fire events. The largest overlaps occur when using the finest spatial resolution (250 m) data. Thus, the spatial resolution of a dataset may influence the results obtained and in turn, the management decisions that may arise from them.

## Why does spatial resolution matter?

<br>

### Best practices and opportunities

In cases where different data resolutions are available, the recommendation is to use data at the finest spatial resolution to ensure that potentially relevant ecological patterns are not missed.

Even though, fine scale data usually leads to improved accuracy of models (Fig. a & b), there are several constraints such as data availability, data storage, computing power, time, and financial resources (Fig. c). Finer grain size (i.e., smaller pixel size) usually leads to improved accuracy but some processes actually plateau at a certain resolution and there is no need to go finer. This is often used as a baseline for future studies. Higher resolution often comes with higher cost and time and hence, it is important to identify the most optimal point for a given study based on resources available.

## How to aggregate data to scale up?

<br>

### Introduction

In addition to the resolution, boundaries used to aggregate smaller scale data may influence the visual assessment of ES supply and demand information and relationships.

## How to aggregate data to scale up?

<br>

### Case study

Pollination supply and demand aggregated to watersheds (left) tend to show ES surplus (i.e. higher ratios) at areas with little demand, while the supply and demand relationships represented at 3km grid cells (right) can help identify more precisely high demand areas that could benefit from more agricultural support.

## How to aggregate data to scale up?

<br>

### Best practices and opportunities

Careful consideration of the aggregation, reporting, or zonal unit by assessing variance or representativeness (i.e., percentage of outcome agreement and disagreement
between scales).

Consider the effects of aggregating information at the ecologically meaningful level into socially meaningful or management scale.

# Challenge: How to consider non-linearities?
`[under construction  note]`

[comment]: <> (PAGE BREAK)

## How to consider non-linearities?

<br>

### Introduction

Often we assume a relationship between two variables is linear; however, if we increase the spatial extent we may see a nonlinear relationship appear. This is important, because we often predict in areas outside of where we sample. If we assume a relationship is linear, when it is not, then our extrapolations will be incorrect.

[comment]: <> (PAGE BREAK)

## How to consider non-linearities?

<br>

### Case study
In this case study, we show the relationship between soil carbon and plant cover in vacant lots in Quebec city. Plant cover can be greater than one in densely vegetated vacant lots when leaves overlap. In this study, vacant lots were carefully selected to represent the entire range of plant cover.

However, a less careful scientist, could have selected only a subset of these vacant lots (green dots, map on left). The relationship between soil carbon and plant cover only within this subset (green dots, middle panel) is linear and would lead to an incorrect extrapolation to the whole study region (gray dots, middle panel).

When using data from the whole study region (e.g., increasing the spatial extent), we find that the relationship is actually non-linear (panel on right). In vacant lots with high plant cover, other factors (e.g., soil type, land use history, etc.) might be needed to better explain the variability of carbon.

## How to consider non-linearities?

<br>

### Best practices and opportunities

If funding and time allows, sample across a larger spatial extent to capture the full range of each variable.

When extrapolating outside of the original study region consider whether the new study region’s environmental variables are within the same range as the original study. If not, consider whether a non-linear relationship is likely.

Seasonality can also result in nonlinear relationships between a variable and time (*e.g.*, temperature). To account for variables that vary across a year, we may need to monitor at the same time each year or more frequently within the year. Phenological changes are shifting with continuing climate change, which makes monitoring more frequently over time especially important.

# Challenge: How does the monitoring time period influence outcomes?
`[under construction  note]`

[comment]: <> (PAGE BREAK)

## How does the monitoring time period influence outcomes?

<br>

### Introduction
Often we use time series analysis to understand whether an ecosystem property or service is changing over time. The temporal extent (*e.g.*, time frame or period) of the monitoring data can affect outcomes. For shorter time-series or time-series with high variability, we may not have a correct historical baseline to detect change. For example, if monitoring data does not extend far enough into the past, then an insignificant trend could be interpreted as evidence for stability or no effect, when in reality the system might already be in a degraded state.

## How does the monitoring time period influence outcomes?

<br>

### Case study
In this example, we show how Chinook salmon populations are changing in the Salmon river, British Columbia, Canada. In this region, Chinook salmon are important for the way of life for Indigenous communities, the economy, and the environment. Here, we show differences in trend significance depending on the start of a monitoring program. For example, if salmon monitoring only started 10 or 20 years ago (click on “since 2010” or “since 2000” buttons), then no significant downward trend would have been detected. However, if we begin our time-series analysis in 1984, then we see a significant downward trend: slope = -0.046 and p-value < 0.001.

## How does the monitoring time period influence outcomes?

<br>

### Best practices and opportunities

Even when monitoring data are available for 30+ years, we know ecosystems have been changing over centuries. For example, current observations of salmon in the Salmon River are very different from historical reports.

>*“In the grey of early morning I was aroused by a commotion, and found the river full of sockeye running upstream. I put in an oar and felt that the river was half fish. The increasing light soon showed that it was red from bank to bank. Then a stampede or panic occurred, and the salmon came surging down, but the river was so full of ascending fish that they blockaded and made a great flat wriggling dam. So jammed were they that they crowded out, and were rushed up the sloping banks out of the water.” -David Salmond Mitchell, fisheries officer 1905*

>Source for quote: Burt DW and Wallis M. 1997. Assessment of salmonid habitat in the salmon river, salmon arm. Department of Fisheries and Oceans. Vancouver, B.C.

When appropriate historical baselines are unavailable, comparisons can be made with an equivalent reference site. However, in the age of the anthropocene, finding an appropriate reference site can also be challenging. Therefore, when reading papers and reports, we suggest to critically evaluate how baselines and reference sites were selected and how these choices could impact outcomes.

# Challenge: Spatial, temporal, & scale mismatches
`[under construction  note]`

[comment]: <> (PAGE BREAK)

## Spatial, temporal, & scale mismatches

<br>

*[This challenge is still under construction and will be finalized after the AGM]*

<br>

### Introduction
In some cases, the supply and demand for an ecosystem service do not overlap in time or space. The interactions and processes connecting the source of supply and its demand are often called “ecosystem service flow”.

No-overlap between supply and demand can occur due to mismatches in space, time, or scale.

[comment]: <> (PAGE BREAK)

## Spatial, temporal, & scale mismatches

<br>

### Case study

Here, we provide examples of when supply and demand don't overlap due to mismatches in space, time, or scale using the ecosystem service of pollination as an example.

1. **Spatial:** when we change the spatial extent of a study, we might miss sources of ES supply or ES beneficiaries. The figure in the left shows an example: Even when habitat for pollinators is constant across two landscapes, farmlands with smaller fields often have higher pollinator abundance, showing the influence of the spatial scale on the supply of pollination.

2. **Temporal:** Not all pollinators are active during all crop bloom seasons. As climate change continues, the phenological response of crop blooms and bee emergence may differ, which may result in greater temporal mismatches.

3. **Scale mismatch:** The whole process of pollination, from the location of pollinators’ habitat, their feeding dynamics and flying range requires a minimum spatial extent and configuration of the habitat that might exceed that of a single farm. In other words, one farmer may not have have enough land to set aside to support pollinator habitat, or an optimal configuration of pollinator habitat, but working together multiple farmers would. So incentives that encourage cooperation among farmers, may be more successful than incentives that support a single farmer increasing bee habitat. This is because the scale of management (a single farm) is too small in spatial extent to match the scale of the process of pollination.

## The future is not like the past

### Introduction
When we study time scales in ecosystem services, we need different tools and approaches for studying past events and processes from those that will occur in the future. And the further we go into the past or into the future, the greater these differences are.

### Best practices and opportunities:

* “Triangulate” from multiple sources

* Use Bayesian methods to combine multiple sources and to retain estimates of the uncertainty

* Consider unconventional sources (e.g. historical photographs, old herbarium records)

* Consider longer time extents than the focus of current decisions (e.g. Lyon, C., Saupe, E.E., Smith, C.J., Hill, D.J., Beckerman, A.P., Stringer, L.C., Marchant, R., Mckay, J., Burke, A., O’Higgins, P., Dunhill, A.M., Allen, B.J., Riel‐Salvatore, J., Aze, T., 2022.

* Model human learning and adaptive management as part of future predictions

* Deliberately include decision makers and beneficiaries of ecosystem services in research related to the future, through techniques such as scenarios

# Challenge: Model comparisons

`[under construction  note]`

[comment]: <> (PAGE BREAK)

## Model comparisons

<br>

### Introduction
Decision-making and research questions are meaningful at specific scales and often need scale-specific models.

![figure_name](Content/Challenges/Challenge5/unknownSourceAskM.png)

Choosing the right size to study natural phenomena is hard for scientists (Oreskes et al., 1994). An appropriate scale determines how detailed and accurate their models are and how much area they can cover. The scale of a study significantly impacts the complexity, accuracy, spatial extent, and generalizability of the models (Brimicombe, 2010).

Researching a local scale or small proportion of the territory requires more complex analyses. Researchers need to consider more variables and their relationships to achieve a reliable approximation of the natural phenomena under investigation. Also, the identification of patterns could be more difficult. Furthermore, obtaining more detailed results demands more computational resources. Nevertheless, it should be noted that higher scales at a finer resolution do not always lead to higher accuracy (Brimicombe, 2010).

On the other hand, examining natural phenomena through regional or global studies may enhance comprehension. Coarser resolutions could lead to reduced complexity, simplifying inputs and outputs. Also, some relationships or patterns emerge to significant geographical extents due to noise reduction. Furthermore, Policymakers tend to favor regional and global scales, as they provide a broader perspective on reality (Brimicombe, 2010; Woolmer et al., 2008).

## Model comparisons

<br>

### Case study
Here, we compared the Human footprint at three scales: Global (Williams et al., 2020), National (Hirsh-Pearson et al., 2022), and Provincial. The human footprint is a cumulative index that quantifies the extent and the intensity of human pressures on ecosystems and biodiversity.

This sample represents the state of human pressure in the northeast of British Columbia. From coarse (global) to detailed (provincial) resolution, we identify how roads are represented to different extents. Regarding complexities, with 8 mapped variables, the global model captures a broad perspective of human interventions in which roads and settlements are the most visible features. The map is improved with the national model, which integrates 12 layers, providing the first appearance of oil and gas infrastructure and mining. The provincial map, which incorporates 16 layers, shows a comprehensive state of the human footprint, including seismic lines, oil and gas wells, and infrastructure, even recreational features.

## Model comparisons

<br>

### Best practices and opportunities

<br>

*[This section is under construction]*

<br>


Models are very sensitive to the input data. The more accurate the input data, the higher the reliability of the model. Furthermore, model evaluation can be a complex process based on the nature and the extent of the phenomena. The larger the spatial and temporal scale of the phenomena, the more complex and challenging it can be to evaluate the model. Lastly, models are developed to be applied at a certain scale (spatial and temporal). A model acceptable at one scale might not be at another.

We suggest the following to improve reliability of models...

* Clear and explicit criteria for every step of the evaluation

* Document all decisions made to incorporate input data

* Be clear about the purpose of the model

* Conduct a sensitivity analysis to test the consistency of the model under a range of input parameters

# Synthesis of the spatial and temporal extents and resolutions of our different studies

<br>

*[This section is under construction]*

<br>


We would like to synthesize the scales at which we work, inclusive of all ResNet related research projects. If you would like to be represented in our synthesis, please fill out our survey (1 response per research project).

Survey link: https://bit.ly/hqp-scale-survey

The purpose of this survey is to gain a better understanding of the spatial extent, spatial grain size, temporal resolution, and time period of research taking place within our network.

Your responses will be featured on our story map. For example, we hope to create a few scatter graphs showing the spatial and temporal scales at which we work (see example below). We will create a unique icon for each ResNet research study, and as the reader hovers over the icon, your name, title of your research project, and link for more information will be visible.

# A landscape of scaling challenges

*[This is placeholder text for a figure that synthesizes some of the challenges we discussed in the story map. We will hire an illustrator after the AGM.]*

*[We will also summarize a few key findings, which may include the following]*
* Most of us study a specific aspect of this landscape. Only by talking more together can we better see how our studies are small pieces that fit together into a bigger picture.

* We found ourselves repeating one best practice over and over again: the need for modelers to talk more with field ecologists and local stakeholders.


# Glossary of  terms and definitions

<br>

*[This section is under construction. References are going to be included in a later stage. Please feel free to suggest any extra definitions and/or terms.]*

<br>

List of terms we will likely need to define and simple definitions

>**Ecosystem Service (ES):** there are many similar, complementary and even contested definitions of ES. Ecosystem services are sometimes broadly defined as the benefits people obtain from nature [1], and more specific as the all the biophysical and social conditions and processes by which people obtain direct or indirect benefits from ecosystems [2, 3]. As a controversial concept, many frameworks have attempted to improve this definition to make it more clear and inclusive [4,5,6].

> **Ecosystem services supply, demand and flow:**

> **Extent:** see spatial and temporal extent definitions below.

> **Grain:** Grain refers to the smallest or finest unit of measurement  in a given data set.

> **Indicators:**

> **Landscape Models:** A model is an abstract representation of a system or a process. When describing or analyzing an ecological process, it is almost impossible to account for  all the variables, interactions, feedback loops, inter-dependencies, etc. among ecosystem components, given the limited basic information available for analyses and processing capacities of computers [6,7].

> **Trade-offs:** Trade-offs occur when the provision of one ES is reduced as a consequence of the provision or use of another ES. For example, carbon storage and sequestration is in trade-offs with timber extraction.

> **Pixel:**

> **Patch:** A region, a portion of surface that differs from its surroundings (e.g a patch of forest differs from a patch of agricultural fields). From a computer modelling perspective, a patch is a contiguous group of cells with the same class or category.

> **Resolution:** Is the precision of a measurement. In the context of spatial analysis, resolution refers to the level of detail at which geographic data is represented. In other words, the resolution determines the smallest object that can be identified as a separate entity on a map or image

> **Spatial extent:** Geographical size and boundaries of the study area.

> **Temporal extent:** Duration of time covered by a process, or a study. It is defined by a specific time period.

> **Watershed:**
