  ## Different scale(s) are most meaningful for a given decision or research question

  We design studies at different scales, because (1) decision-makers require data at different spatio-temporal scales and (2) scientists seek to understand how ecosystem processes and properties vary across scales. There are cost and time constraints to collecting data; therefore, we target the scale most relevant for a given question or decision.

  `Text for image: The idea behind this drawing is to start as a decision-maker, researcher, and/or explorer, and show how the view (scale) may change, in a fun way, before we dive into the scientific details. We will finish this sketch after the AGM.`
