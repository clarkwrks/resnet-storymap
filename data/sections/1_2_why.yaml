  # What is ResNet? 
  We are part of the ResNet network that unites a broad community of scholars, NGO, government, and industry sectors. We are based in different working landscapes along Canada, and our aim is to improve our capacity to monitor, model, and manage these landscapes and all the ecosystem services that they provide for long-term well-being and shared prosperity.

  Introduction to the process of creating this story map
  Together as students and postdocs within the multi-scale ResNet network, we discuss a few of the challenges and best practices related to scaling. [Add link to who we are? section].
