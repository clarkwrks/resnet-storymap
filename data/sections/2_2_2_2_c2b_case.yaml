  ## Challenge: How to aggregate data to scale up  
  
  ### Case study  
  
  Pollination supply and demand aggregated to watersheds (left) tend to show ecosystem service surplus (i.e. higher ratios) at areas with little demand, while the supply and demand relationships represented at 3km grid cells (right) can help identify more precisely high demand areas that could benefit from more agricultural support.
