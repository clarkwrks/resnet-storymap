  ## Project Status 
  ### This is a living project. We're making this work-in-progress publically visible to faciliate collaboration across our spatially, temporally, and thematically expansive group. Thank you for your understanding.
  - Layout
    - Inset full width with parallax bg scroll
      - Blocked by leaflet layer etc... js issue
    - Case study 'icons'
      - Most useful with logical, consistent placement. Anything towards right will block leaflet interaction
  - Admin
    - Consistently styled banner for under construction, AGM only
    - Within markdown+yaml, inline css classes for img sizing etc https://roneo.org/en/hugo-custom-css-classes-images-markdown-attributes/
      - inline class assignment works `{.custom-css-class}|{.myclass class="custom-css-class1 custom-class2"}`
        - well... for markdown, not hugo-parsed-markdown. solutions out there. something in render-hooks
