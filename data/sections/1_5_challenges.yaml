  ### Introduction
  
  Environmental processes & properties can change as we change scales (both grain and extent). However, more often, the method choices we make can lead to misleading results as we extend our research to other scales. These choices include how we decide where to draw boundaries, deal with non-linearities, and account for inconsistent baselines. We illustrate this challenge with several case studies, includingâ€¦
  
  * Why does spatial resolution matter?

  * How do we draw boundaries to aggregate data?

  * How to consider non-linearities?

  * How does the monitoring time period influence outcomes?
