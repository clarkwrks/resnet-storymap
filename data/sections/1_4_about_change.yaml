  ## Changing spatial and temporal scales

  Often data is only available (or can only be collected) at one scale; however, we need information at a different scale to inform a decision or to understand an ecological process. In the figure below we visualize what it means to increase (a) spatial grain size, (b) spatial extent, (c) temporal resolution, and (d) time period.
