  ## Introduction
  
  In some cases, the supply and demand for an ecosystem service do not overlap in time or space. The interactions and processes connecting the source of supply and its demand are often called “ecosystem service flow”.

  No-overlap between supply and demand can occur due to mismatches in space, time, or scale.
