  ## Challenge: Why field sampling matters

  ### Best practices and opportunities:

  `[This section is under construction and will be updated after the AGM; however, we provide notes of our current thoughts]`

  Field work requires
  - Funding
  - A network of researchers sharing instruments
  - Selecting an appropriate sampling scheme to support scaling
  - Careful planning, to avoid unexpected issues and get the data as efficiently as possible
  - Capture of as much variation as you can
  - Collaboration of modelers and field ecologists - help identify the type of data you need, before you go and collect it
  - Standardization of methodologies (include a graphic showing how methods may differ and hinder comparisons across time, space, and scales)
  - Missing data issue
  - Best practices are already known for many fields (*e.g.*, [Best practice for upscaling soil organic carbon stocks in salt marshes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706122004955)
