  ## Why do we scale up or down?

  We may scale up or down for many reasons, including these examples:
  
  1.   It can be expensive, time-consuming, and dangerous to collect data points in the field at every possible location. Instead, we stratify (e.g., partition) a larger landscape into smaller homogenous areas and take representative samples within each group.
  2.   Ecological processes can be difficult to observe directly, including when processes are too fast, too slow, too small, or too large. We develop models to visualize a reality that is inaccessible to our senses. 
  3.   Management and policy decisions may require data at a different scale (e.g., extent or grain) compared to the scale of available data. For example, we may collect field data about a management intervention at a local scale; however, we may rely on models to test how scaling these interventions could affect outcomes at a larger scale.
  4.  There are many decision-makers at different (nested) spatial scales, with their own mandates, agendas, and actions. Land-use planning policies are often developed considering scales that represent political needs at regional scales, which may or may not be consistent with ecological and societal needs at local scales. For example, climate change mitigation actions at a national scale, may not address heterogeneous needs at finer scales, for example cooling effects at the neighborhood scale.
