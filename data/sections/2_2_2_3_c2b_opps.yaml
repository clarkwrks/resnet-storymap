  Careful consideration of the aggregation, reporting, or zonal unit by assessing variance or representativeness (i.e., percentage of outcome agreement and disagreement
  between scales).

  Consider the effects of aggregating information at the ecologically meaningful level into socially meaningful or management scale.
