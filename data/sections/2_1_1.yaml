  ## Challenge / overview of why field sampling matters
  - (Brittney & David) Trade-off between the need for field data but the time and funding needed to collect and process field samples
  - These challenges - and why these challenges matter - explain nuances of collecting data
  - Heterogeneity of the environment
  - Background research needed to choose a proper sampling scheme
  - Balancing within site and between variability
  - Ideal sampling vs what’s actually feasible (resources, time, $, administrative)
  - Cost - collection and analysis (lab work)
  - Unexpected situations (e.g. equipment breaking) - need to be flexible (best laid plans, often fail?)
  - Explain what those N/As are about (missing data)
  - Physical work / bugs
  - Environmental/ecological challenges (bears, flooding, fire, tides, navigation)
  - Different methodologies used (how to upscale when data collected from different methods - Apples to Oranges?)
  

  ### You may have seen something like the map below - where do these ‘C stock’ numbers come from?

  ## Case studies  
  - Origin story of where data comes from (It’s not delivered by a stork). Pictures of field work and discussion of lengthy process to collect and process a single soil core  
  - Ideas for visualization: Maybe a slide deck with dots that changes as you move through time. Maybe separate slide decks for field and lab steps

  Case Study 1 - Carbon stocks within a chronosequence of restored salt marshes in  the Bay of Fundy  


  [Many examples of sampling locations and action photos in slides, but not in drive. Unable to use currently.]

  ## Best practices and opportunities: Requires (1) funding (2) a network of researchers sharing instruments, (3) selecting an appropriate sampling scheme to support scaling (Brittney and David, feel free to change these to best match your case study)
  - Spending the time planning your field work (to help with unexpected things, and get the data as efficiently as possible)
  - Capture as much variation as you can
  - Integration of modelers and field data - help identify the type of data you need (before you go and collect it) - collaboration
  - Standardizing methodologies
  - Graphic showing how methods may differ and hinder comparisons across time, space, and scales
  - Missing data issue
