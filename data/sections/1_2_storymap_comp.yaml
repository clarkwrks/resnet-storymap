  Storymap App
  - Storymap.js (https://github.com/jakobzhao/storymap) = leaflet*javascript events
  - Extended by Guillaume LaRoque to use Hugo templating
    - See https://apps.nsercresnet.ca/story/monteregie/en/  
  
  Three main components:  
  - Navbar
  - Story Container
  - Map Container
  
  Each story section or 'slide' has an associated map scene. Once a user scrolls past the end of a story slide, the app advances to the next slide and scene.
