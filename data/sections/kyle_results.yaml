left_title: "Bees play a key role in orchards"
left_text: "The amount of apples produced and the number of seeds in those apples increased with increasing functional diversity of bees. Conserving wild bee habitats near orchards can help secure crop pollination by encouraging a greater diversity of bees.<br><br> Apple fruit set and seed set was higher in orchards high more bee diversity. Complementarity between managed and unmanaged bees drove this relationship. Orchards with bee habitats (meadows, forests) nearby had higher bee diversity when crops were in bloom.<br><a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2014.10.018' target='_blank'>Link to scientific article</a>"
