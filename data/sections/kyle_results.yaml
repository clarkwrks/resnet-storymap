left_text: "The amount of apples produced and the number of seeds in those apples increases with the functional diversity of bees. Conserving wild bee habitats near orchards can help secure crop pollination.<br><br>Apple fruit set and seed set in orchards increased with bee diversity. Complementarity between managed and unmanaged bees drove this relationship. Orchards with bee habitats (meadows, forests) nearby had higher bee diversity when crops were in bloom."
